## Goal of the Project

With the front end provided create a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## Project Requirements

- I want to be able to view, create and track daily workouts;

- On the homepage I can view the stats of my last workout, and can choose to continue a workout or create a new workout;

- When I create a new workout, I am taken to the exercise page and prompted to select either cardio or resistance.;

- When I select cardio, I am prompted to enter the name of the exercise, its duration, and distance;

- Upon clicking a timeblock, an event can be entered in the text box;

- When I select resistance, I am prompted to enter the name of the exercise, the duration, weight, reps and sets;

- When I continue a workout I can modify the contents that need updating;

- When I click to view the dashboard page, I can view a graph displaying the total weight of my resistance workouts from the past seven days. I can view a second graph displaying the total duration of my cadio workouts.
